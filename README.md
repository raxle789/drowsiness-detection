# Drowsiness Detection ML Model

In this project we create a machine learning model that can detect drowsiness. This machine learning model can detect users with and without glasses. The following points can be explained about this model:

- The model uses a dataset of 2,380 images, 1,190 images each for open eyes and closed eyes labels.
- The model was trained using transfer learning techniques from the Mobile Net V2 model.
- This model has the following statistical results, loss: 0.0280, accuracy: 0.9905, val_loss: 0.2804, and val_accuracy: 0.9475

Here is a demo of the machine learning model using python:
